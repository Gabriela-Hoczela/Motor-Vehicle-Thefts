# Motor-Vehicle-Thefts
Motor Vehicle Thefts Project 
Project based on Maven Analytics dataset.

This project concerns the analysis of vehicle theft. The aim is to identify trends related to theft in different regions, vehicle types and other characteristics such as colour, day of the week or average age of the vehicle. The MySQL database was imported into MSSMS and then tables were created using SQL queries, which were used in MSExcel to create pivot tables and charts. The dashboard consists of 3 sheets:

The first sheet is an introduction with a short description of the project, a description of the other sheets and information on how to navigate the project.
The second sheet shows the analysis on charts. Charts showing key metrics related to vehicle theft, with the ability to filter data by region and vehicle type.
The third sheet is a Pivot Table Analysis. Tables with key indicators that provide detailed vehicle theft figures, grouped by different categories. As a result of the analysis, we can answer the key questions of "when", "which" and "what" vehicles are likely to be stolen.
